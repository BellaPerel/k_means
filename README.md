This Python script is built for conducting k-means clustering on a dataset. It imports necessary modules, defines a data loader (load_data), and runs the k-means algorithm (run_kmeans).
The latter checks and extracts command-line arguments, validates inputs, loads data, performs clustering, and prints the results.
It emphasizes modularity and ease of use, making it adaptable for various datasets and k-means configurations.
